The solution is within Advanced-JS_LabSolution

It contains the following files:

    01-weather.html = HTML code for the application

    index.css = Styling for the HTML

    main.js = Javascript for the application

    backgroiund.jpg = Background image used
    

I have also added a screenshot pdf for reference.
